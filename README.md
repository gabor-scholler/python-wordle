# Python Wordle
A very simple python version of the "Wordle" word game. 

### What is 'Wordle'?
Wordle is a game where a user is given 6 tries to figure out a word which consists of 5 letters. The program will generate a random 5-letter word from a list, and
then ask the user for an input. If a letter from the user's input appears in the secret generated word, the user will be told. The user will also be told if a specific
letter is in the right place.

The only difference in this game is that it doesn't operate with colours, and that the user is given unlimited tries! 

*Enjoy!*
